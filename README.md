Development of an website prototype featuring a minimalist portfolio style.

**🤔 Understanding:**

- Make the responsiveness more intricate and adaptable.
- Above all, practice and enhance my skills.

### 🔁 Reflections

> [!NOTE]
> This second website allows me to enhance responsiveness and dynamism on simple elements like texts. The purpose of this second site is to implement various dynamic ideas "from Scratch". I was able to add a more modern and dynamic navigation. The site is still in progress; I will refine it gradually, but I do not plan to add other pages (such as contact, portfolio, etc.). I want this second site to remain as a single animated landing page with a certain visual aesthetic. The responsiveness is actually better managed in this project than in "WebsiteOne". I managed to add a fairly decent responsiveness to this project.
